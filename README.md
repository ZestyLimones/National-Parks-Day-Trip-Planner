## User Story

```
As AN American traveler
I WANT to see a few National Parks in a certain state, with weather and activities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly. 
```

## Criteria

```
* Use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.

* Be deployed to GitHub Pages.

* Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

* Use at least two server-side APIs

* Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).

* Use client-side storage to store persistent data.

* Be responsive.

* Have a polished UI.

* Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).

* Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
```

## Our Experience

```
Initially, we had very different ideas for this application. Finding
API's that worked for what we needed proved to be a little difficult.
We were able to adapt our idea into this and we were very proud of that. 
We love the idea of being outdoors, and with that in mind we decided
that being able to plan a trip to a state park and seeing what activities 
were there, and the weather for the next 5 days would be very nice. We definitely
met with difficulties with the different API's and learning a new CSS framework,
but as a team we were able to overcome these. Github presented some isses, and
using the Google Maps API wasn't very logical. We had fun!

```

## Future Development

```
* Make the activities section more descriptive. Add actual activities to do not just descriptions
 of those activites (fishing spots, hiking trails, etc.)
* A more responsive site for different screen sizes (especially extremely mobile friendly)
* Add a feature to search by location rather than state (find closest park to user)
* Adding user profiles/favorites so that user can come back and see previously planned trips
* FAR - Add a system to keep track of national parks that you've visited. Maybe add badges and awards.
